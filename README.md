When verifying the PGP key you will get an error.
`gpg: Signature made Sat Apr 17 19:52:39 2021 UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 87EE482FE0942D570EBCFD8B6EECA6DEF1CFFB33
gpg: Good signature from "fdoving (Github) <fd21@pm.me>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 87EE 482F E094 2D57 0EBC  FD8B 6EEC A6DE F1CF FB33`

This is because I have not linked the PGP key to my identity.
I am not verified to be me, by anyone. 
I belive the signature still is valid, as it verifies that I am the source of the information you get.
