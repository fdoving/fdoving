****PGP Fingerprint: 87EE482FE0942D570EBCFD8B6EECA6DEF1CFFB33****


When verifying the PGP key you will get WARNING.

``gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.``


This is because I have not linked the PGP key to my identity.
I am not verified to be me, by anyone. 
I belive the signature still is valid, as it verifies that I am the source of the information you get.
